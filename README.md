# Teaching Quality Assessment using HLSN

This repository contains the code for the **Hetero Long Short-term Network (HLSN)**, a deep learning-based framework for real-time teaching quality assessment. The model uses classroom video data to dynamically evaluate student learning behaviors and provide feedback on teaching management quality.
**The code is coming soon.**

## Overview

With the advancement of educational technology, traditional methods of assessing teaching quality are shifting toward data-driven and automated approaches. The **HLSN** model integrates deep learning techniques, specifically object detection and behavior analysis, to provide a real-time, dynamic evaluation of classroom teaching quality. The model employs the **YOLOv8** framework for student behavior detection and integrates a **Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph Convolution (MHGC)** module to address occlusion challenges and a **Long Short-term Memory Bank (LSMB)** module to handle temporal dynamics in student behaviors.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Behavior Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate tracking of student behavior in classroom videos.
- **Occlusion Handling:** The MHGC module enhances feature extraction even in occluded areas, improving accuracy in complex classroom settings.
- **Temporal Modeling:** The LSMB module captures both short-term and long-term changes in student learning states, ensuring stability in assessment.
- **Dynamic Teaching Quality Evaluation:** The model provides real-time, continuous feedback based on student engagement and behavior.
